# Secret AGI Implementation Status & TODO

## ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1: Async Game Engine + Database (July 2025)

### Database Infrastructure
- [x] ✅ SQLModel + SQLite database with 9 tables
- [x] ✅ Alembic migrations with auto-generation  
- [x] ✅ Async aiosqlite driver integration
- [x] ✅ Complete CRUD operations layer
- [x] ✅ State serialization with enum handling
- [x] ✅ Transaction safety and rollback handling

### Game Engine Consolidation
- [x] ✅ Eliminated dual sync/async implementations (80% code deduplication)
- [x] ✅ Single async-only GameEngine with mandatory database persistence
- [x] ✅ All 116 tests migrated to async patterns
- [x] ✅ Database-first architecture (no enable_persistence toggle)
- [x] ✅ In-memory SQLite support for testing

### Quality & Tooling
- [x] ✅ 0 mypy errors with strict type checking
- [x] ✅ Complete ruff linting and formatting
- [x] ✅ All 116 tests passing with async engine
- [x] ✅ Justfile with database migration commands
- [x] ✅ 72-100% game completion rates across player counts

### Game Mechanics & Rules
- [x] ✅ Complete Secret AGI rules implementation
- [x] ✅ All powers, win conditions, and special mechanics
- [x] ✅ Emergency safety, veto system, player elimination
- [x] ✅ Comprehensive scenario testing (14 additional tests)
- [x] ✅ RandomPlayer implementation for automated testing

## 📍 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Production-Ready Components (Phase 1 Complete)
The async game engine with database persistence is **production-ready** and supports:
- **Complete rule implementation** - All Secret AGI mechanics working correctly
- **Database persistence** - Every action and state change automatically saved
- **Type safety** - 0 mypy errors with strict configuration  
- **Quality assurance** - 116/116 tests passing, full linting pipeline
- **Game reliability** - 72-100% completion rates across player counts
- **Developer experience** - Complete Justfile workflow with database commands

## ⏳ TODO - Phase 2: Agent Orchestrator & Web API

### 2.1 Agent Orchestrator Service 🔄 HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Create ADK agent session management
- [ ] Implement turn-based agent activation
- [ ] Add agent timeout and fallback handling
- [ ] Create agent-to-engine communication bridge
- [ ] Add agent performance monitoring

### 2.2 Web API Development 🌐 HIGH PRIORITY  
- [ ] FastAPI application setup
- [ ] Game management endpoints (create, monitor, control)
- [ ] Real-time game state WebSocket endpoints
- [ ] Game history and replay APIs
- [ ] Agent performance analytics endpoints

### 2.3 Web UI Implementation 🖥️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] HTML/CSS/JavaScript game viewer
- [ ] Real-time board state visualization
- [ ] Game history browser and replay controls
- [ ] Agent performance dashboard
- [ ] Debug panel for development

### 2.4 ADK Integration 🤖 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] ADK session lifecycle management
- [ ] Agent tool interface implementation
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination system
