- **Debug Tools**: GameEngine debug mode with comprehensive action logging
- **Error Recovery**: Agents that fail gracefully fallback to observe actions

### Technical Implementation Details:

**SimpleOrchestrator Architecture**:
```python
# Multi-agent game coordination
async def run_game(self, players: List[BasePlayer]) -> Dict[str, Any]
async def _run_game_loop(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
async def _process_player_turn(self, player: BasePlayer) -> bool
```

**Web API Integration**:
- In-memory SQLite for web games (isolated from main database)

## Enhanced Game Log Implementation (2025-07-04)

Successfully implemented comprehensive action-by-action logging for the web interface, providing complete visibility into agent decision-making processes.

### Implementation Overview:

**User Request**: "The game log is not detailed enough. I want every action to be shown" along with "Also, I want to use on-disk db for this tests."

**Solution**: Enhanced the web API game log endpoint to pull detailed action history directly from the database rather than the minimal in-memory log.

### Technical Implementation:

**1. Database Query Methods**:
- Added `get_actions_for_game(session, game_id)` method to GameOperations
- Added `get_events_for_game(session, game_id)` method to GameOperations  
- Proper SQLAlchemy query patterns with ordering by turn_number and created_at

**2. Web API Enhancement**:
- Enhanced `/game-log` endpoint to access database through orchestrator's engine
- Rich action detail parsing with parameters and validation status
- Status indicators: ✅ success, ❌ failure, ⏳ processing
- Action parameter extraction for different action types

- Changed from `sqlite:///:memory:` to `sqlite:///web_games.db` for web games
- Persistent storage enables session continuity and game replay
- Proper database connection sharing through orchestrator's engine

### Action Detail Format:

**Comprehensive Action Logging**:
```
Turn 1: ✅ player_4 → nominate (target: player_4)
Turn 2: ✅ player_1 → vote_team (YES)
Turn 7: ✅ player_4 → discard_paper (paper: paper_3)  
Turn 8: ✅ player_4 → publish_paper (paper: paper_11)
📡 Paper Published - Paper: C+3, S+0
```

**Action Types Supported**:
- `nominate` - Shows target player
- `vote_team`/`vote_emergency` - Shows YES/NO choice
- `discard_paper`/`publish_paper` - Shows paper ID
- `declare_veto`/`respond_veto` - Shows veto responses
- `use_power` - Shows target for power effects
- `call_emergency_safety` - Emergency vote initiation

### Database Operations Enhancement:

**New Methods Added**:
```python
@staticmethod
async def get_actions_for_game(session: AsyncSession, game_id: str) -> list[Action]:
    """Get all actions for a specific game."""
    
@staticmethod  
async def get_events_for_game(session: AsyncSession, game_id: str) -> list[Event]:
    """Get all events for a specific game."""
```

**Query Implementation**:
- Proper ordering by turn_number and creation timestamp
- Complete action history retrieval for any game_id
- Events retrieval for significant game occurrences

### Technical Challenges Resolved:

**1. Database Connection Sharing**:
- **Problem**: Web API using different database connection than orchestrator
- **Solution**: Access database through orchestrator's engine for connection sharing

- **Problem**: Raw action_data JSON needs user-friendly formatting
- **Solution**: Action-type-specific parameter extraction and formatting
- **Result**: Clear, readable action descriptions with relevant details

**3. Pydantic Model Compatibility**:
- **Problem**: GameResponse.data expected Dict but game log returns list
- **Solution**: Changed data field type to Optional[Any] for flexibility
- **Result**: API endpoint properly handles both dict and list response data

### Validation Results:

**Database Verification**:
- ✅ Actions properly stored in database (verified 58 actions for sample game)
- ✅ Game_id mapping correct between orchestrator and API
- ✅ Turn ordering and action sequencing preserved

**Web Interface Testing**:
- ✅ Enhanced log endpoint retrieves detailed action history
