This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Secret AGI is a multi-agent game system where AI agents play a social deduction game. The system is designed for controlled experiments comparing different agent architectures through automated gameplay and comprehensive performance analysis.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Game Engine Service**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implements Secret AGI game logic and maintains authoritative game state
2. **Agent Orchestrator Service**: ⏳ **PLANNED** - Coordinates independent ADK agents and manages game flow
3. **Agent Framework**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Provides standardized interface for diverse agent implementations
4. **Storage Layer**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - SQLite database with SQLModel ORM and Alembic migrations
5. **Web API**: ⏳ **PLANNED** - FastAPI-based REST API for UI and external control
6. **Web UI**: ⏳ **PLANNED** - Browser-based interface for monitoring and control

### Key Design Principles

- **Async-Only Architecture**: Single async GameEngine with mandatory database persistence
- **Sequential Game Execution**: No concurrent games - simplifies state management  
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete state snapshots after each action for replay/branching
- **Tool-Based Agent Interface**: Agents interact exclusively through async tools
- **Database-First Design**: All operations persist to SQLite with automatic migrations

## Game Rules Implementation

The game follows the complete rules defined in `SECRET_AGI_RULES.md`:
- 5-10 player social deduction game
- Safety Researchers vs Accelerationists vs AGI
- Research phases with paper publishing mechanics
- Powers, veto system, and emergency safety mechanics
- Multiple win conditions based on Capability/Safety metrics

## Agent Tools Interface

Agents interact through these standardized tools:
- `nominate(player_id)` - Director nominates Engineer
- `vote_team(yes/no)` - Vote on proposed team
- `vote_emergency(yes/no)` - Vote on Emergency Safety
- `call_emergency_safety()` - Initiate Emergency Safety vote
- `discard_paper(paper_id)` - Director discards papers
- `publish_paper(paper_id)` - Engineer publishes papers
- `declare_veto()` - Engineer declares veto
- `respond_veto(agree/disagree)` - Director responds to veto
- `use_power(target_id)` - Execute power on target
- `send_chat_message(text)` - Send chat messages
- `observe()` - Get updates without action

## Data Flow

1. **Game Initialization**: API creates game → Agent Orchestrator instantiates agents → Role assignments
2. **Turn Execution**: Context building → Agent decision → Action validation → State update → Event logging
3. **Branching/Replay**: Load historical state → Create new game → Continue from branch point

## Database Schema

Key tables include:
- `Games`: Game configuration and metadata
- `GameStates`: Complete state snapshots for replay
- `Players`: Player-agent assignments and roles
- `Actions`: Complete action history with validation
- `Events`: Sequential game events
- `ChatMessages`: Chat communications
- `Metrics`: Performance data per agent per turn

## Error Handling

- **Agent Failures**: Configurable timeouts, retry with backoff, fallback to random valid actions
- **Invalid Actions**: Clear error messages, logged for analysis, no state changes
- **System Recovery**: Database transactions, automatic checkpoints, recovery from latest valid state

## Extension Points

- **New Agent Types**: Implement base agent interface → Register with orchestrator
- **Custom Analysis**: Query database → Implement analysis logic → Expose via API
- **Game Variants**: Modify game engine validation → Update state machine → Extend tools if needed

## Development Rules

- KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
- YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

## Development Memories

- Always use jj to set commit messages. Never output them as text. Don't add yourself (Claude) to commit message or a a co-author.
- I feel we're complicating our life by adding new features before all tests are passing. Make sure all tests are passing after every time you make changes
- **IMPORTANT**: ALWAYS use jj (Jujutsu) for version control operations, NEVER git. This is a jj repository.
- Don't remove documentation files unless prompted to
